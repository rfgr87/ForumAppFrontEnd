This proyect is meant to serve as a small simple forum were there is a subject and different users can comment on the subject.

To use this proyect git clone two repositories to a main directory. Once in the destined repository use the commands git clone 'git@github.com:rfgr87/ForumAppFrontEnd.git'. Also clone to the same directory git clone 'git@github.com:rfgr87/ForumApp.git'.
